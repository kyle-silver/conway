Conway's Game of Life
---

NOTE: Only verified to work on Windows 10, initially issues were reported with the executable having the wrong version of Java set as its default for execution, but this has since been fixed.

**Controls**
*Left click* to "populate" cells
*Right click* to erase. 
*Pause* to halt the game in its current state
*Step* to move one iteration forward
*Clear* to erase everything on-screen

Clicking and dragging is supported, and the screen can be drawn on even when the game is unpaused
